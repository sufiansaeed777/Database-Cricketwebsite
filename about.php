                The ICC is the global governing body for cricket. Representing 104 members, the
                ICC governs and administrates the game and works with our members to grow the

                The ICC presides over the ICC Code of Conduct, playing conditions, the Decision
                Review System and other ICC regulations. The ICC also appoints all match
                officials that officiate at all sanctioned international matches. Through the
